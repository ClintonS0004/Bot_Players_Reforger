# Bot Players Reforger
My Mod for Arma Reforger (currently PC and Xbox). Written in Enfusion Scripting (heavily based off C#)
Each Arma game features NPC's which fight within the game's sandbox. NPC's also follow a team structure for movement and awareness. This mod gives players the ability to add bots into their match. (The game rules are controlled by entities which live on the map/world. Matches work by opening a world. My mod doesn't have a world, instead it places itself into other people's worlds. Thus you can use this with other peoples modded world, weapons and AI etc.) NPC's are created at player respawn points and are given the same starting gear that is offered to players. This mod takes advantage of modded factions and gear, which is quite fun
