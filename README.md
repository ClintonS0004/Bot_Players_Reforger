# Bot Players Reforger
A mod for the video game Arma Reforger (on PC and Xbox). Writen in a custom scripting language made by the game's devs (heavily based off C#)
The Arma series has NPC's which fight in the game's sandbox with similar capabilities to human players. (NPC's also follow a team structure for movement and awareness). This mod adds the spawning of NPC's into other peoples scenarios. NPC's are created at player respawn points and are given the default items which players are offered.
